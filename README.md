# PIV FlickerFixer attachment

This is a recreation from original data of the small snap off PCB of the PicassoIV (PIV)
Amiga RTG graphics card.
I created this because often cards seem to be sold without this PCB and then the FlickerFixer/ScanDoubler
of the card cannot be used.

The design hasn't been proven yet but as said is created from the original schematics and PCB layout.

This is a four layer PCB.
